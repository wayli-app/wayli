-- Place Visits Materialized View
-- Detects POI visits using dual-source detection (single table scan):
--   1. PRIMARY: geocode->properties when layer is 'venue' (user is AT the venue)
--   2. FALLBACK: nearby_pois array when primary isn't a venue
-- Both sources are included in output for GPS inaccuracy visibility
-- NOTE: Migration 017 converts this to a regular table with incremental updates.
