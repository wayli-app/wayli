/**
 * Segment-level signals computed once per Viterbi segment (not per point) and

 * to whole-journey context that per-point features can't capture:
 *
 *  - `touchesStation`: true if ANY point in this movement segment was at a train
 *    station. Made segment-contagious (the whole moving segment leans train)
 *    rather than boosting only the single station point — this is what lets a
 *    station visit at the start/end anchor the whole train journey.
 *  - `meanIntervalSec`: mean inter-point interval for the segment. Empirically,
 *    car trips (phone navigation on) produce dense fixes while train trips
 *    (phone idle) produce sparse ones; this is a weak-but-free discriminator
 *    derived from the already-computed time_spent.

 * `prevObs` should be the last N observations of the previous batch (most-recent
 * last). They are prepended for feature extraction + Viterbi context and then
 * trimmed from the returned decisions, so the output stays 1:1 with the current
 * batch's observations. A >SEGMENT_GAP_MS gap between the tail and the current
 * batch splits them naturally (the tail's recomputed decisions are discarded).
