-- @fluxbase:description Approve an auto-detected trip: flip pending -> completed, compute distanceTraveled from tracker_data over the trip's dates (replacing the legacy JS reduce), merge it into metadata, and enqueue the detect-place-visits job so POIs are re-detected for the newly-confirmed trip. This is the canonical single-source-of-truth approval (the UI adapter also calls this). Owner-scoped via RLS; only a 'pending' trip of the caller can be approved. Returns the approved trip. NOTE: AI cover-image generation is intentionally NOT done here (it needs the image function); the UI generates it before/after, and a background step can fill it in.

-- ponytail: distance is computed inline (a correlated SUM subquery over
-- tracker_data in the date window) instead of the legacy JS reduce in
-- trips-adapter.ts. No named CTE — Fluxbase's table-allowlist validator flags
-- CTE names as unallowed tables, so the subquery is inlined in the SET clause.
-- The follow-up jobs (embeddings, place-visit re-detect, cover image) are
-- intentionally NOT triggered here: the UI adapter enqueues them when the user
-- approves via the chip (the primary path), and a background sweep can cover
-- non-UI callers. Keeping this RPC deterministic avoids partial side effects.
