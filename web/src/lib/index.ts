// ðŸ”„ LIB RE-EXPORTS
// This file provides backward compatibility by re-exporting from the new environment structure
// This allows existing code to continue working while we migrate to the new structure

// Note: Client directory structure has been refactored
// Exports are now located directly in lib/
// This file is kept for backward compatibility
