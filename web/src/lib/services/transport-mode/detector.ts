 * SEGMENT_GAP_MS (5 min) — each segment is decoded independently with Viterbi,
 * which is exactly the boundary where prior context (a tunnel, a flight) should
 * no longer influence the current mode.
 *
 * `context` lets the caller carry over the tail of the previous batch so a
 * journey that spans a page/batch boundary is decoded as one Viterbi segment
 * rather than two independent halves. The returned decisions are always 1:1
 * with `observations` (the context tail is prepended for context only and then
 * trimmed from the output). A >SEGMENT_GAP_MS gap between the tail and the
 * current batch splits them naturally. `prevObs` in the returned context is the
 * trailing observations of the combined sequence, ready to thread to the next
 * call.
 *
 * Returns one PointModeDecision per input observation, index-aligned.
