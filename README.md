# Wayli üó∫Ô∏è

[![Build Status](#)](#) [![Coverage Status](#)](#)

Alright, so... Wayli is basically a privacy-first location analysis app. The whole thing is kind of a love letter to people who want to track their travels without selling their soul to big tech.

## What it does

- Tracks your GPS movements and automatically figures out your trips
- Tries to guess your transport mode (car, train, bike, etc.)
- Lets you upload cover photos for trips, and integrates with Unsplash for pretty pictures
- Export everything because YOUR data is YOURS
- Privacy-first: your data, your control

## The vibe-coded stack

- **Frontend**: SvelteKit + TypeScript + Tailwind (because who doesn't love a good component framework)
- **Backend**: Supabase doing the heavy lifting (PostgreSQL, auth, storage, the works)
- **Architecture**: Got this whole layered thing going on - services, stores, API handlers, the full shebang. It's actually pretty well organized... for something mostly vibe-coded

**Fun facts:**
- Actually has test coverage goals (85%+) which is wild for a vibe-coded project
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliant because accessibility matters
- Has this whole service manager architecture with client-safe vs server-only services

The codebase is at `/web` and honestly it's got more structure than you'd expect. Check out the [web README](web/README.md) for the full architecture breakdown.

## Quick Start
```bash
git clone https://github.com/wayli-app/wayli.git
cd wayli/web
npm install
npm run dev
```

## üöÄ Semantic Versioning

This project uses automatic semantic versioning based on [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/). The CI pipeline automatically:

- Analyzes commit messages to determine version bumps
- Creates semantic version tags (e.g., `v1.2.3`)
- Updates the CHANGELOG.md file
- Creates GitHub releases
- Tags Docker images with semantic versions

### üìù Commit Message Format

- `docs`: Documentation changes (patch version bump)
- `style`: Code style changes (patch version bump)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring (patch version bump)
- `perf`: Performance improvements (patch version bump)
- `test`: Test changes (patch version bump)
- `build`: Build system changes (patch version bump)
- `ci`: CI/CD changes (patch version bump)
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks (patch version bump)
- `revert`: Revert previous commit (patch version bump)

#### Scopes:
- `web`: Web application
- `api`: API endpoints
- `db`: Database changes
- `auth`: Authentication related
- `ui`: User interface
- `worker`: Background workers
- `docker`: Docker configuration

```bash
git commit -m "feat(web): add user dashboard"
git commit -m "fix(auth): resolve login token expiration issue"
git commit -m "docs(api): update API documentation"
git commit -m "ci: add semantic versioning workflow"
```

#### Breaking Changes:
Use `BREAKING CHANGE:` in the footer for major version bumps:
```bash
git commit -m "feat(api): change user endpoint response format

BREAKING CHANGE: The user endpoint now returns user data in a different format."
```
